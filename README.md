# Welcome!

if you like it and have a pretty decent skill on css, might as well contribute to the code by optimizing it. <br>
my code is just bad and so cluttered. <br>

please aware that it's not perfect, i optimized the code for windowed use and i use Windows 11, you might need to readjust the code based on your setup.
